I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Information Studies, Univerisity of Maryland, College Park. As a research assistant at the Intelligent Assistive Machines (IAM) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Hernisa Kacorri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=El-R5MEAAAAJ), I create accessible technology for teaching machine learning and explainable AI.

Previously I was a game designer and software engineer at StudyPad (Now SplashLearn) in late-Mid 2017, where I designed and developed games for learning math. And before that, I was a Research Scientist at IBM Research Labs, New Delhi, India. Primarily, I worked on the intersection of HCI and ML algorithms, designing and developing machine learning-based technologies for use-cases in childhood learning, in collaboration with Sesame Street.
