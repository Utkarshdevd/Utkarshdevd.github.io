I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the School of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on human-centered artificial intelligence and participatory learning. Specifically, as a research assistant at the [Intelligent Assistive Machines (IAM) lab](https://iam.umd.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Hernisa Kacorri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=El-R5MEAAAAJ) and [Dr. Elizabeth Bonsignore](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth-Bonsignore), I explore inclusive ways for exposing youth to AI black boxes.

Before the Ph.D. program, I was a game designer and software engineer at StudyPad (Now [SplashLearn](https://www.splashlearn.com/)) in 2017, designing and developing games for learning math. And before that, I was a Research Scientist at the Education Business Unit at [IBM Research Labs](https://research.ibm.com/labs/india/), New Delhi, India. At IBM, I designed and developed AI-infused systems leveraging eye-tracking, and I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Sesame Street](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2016/04/27/how-sesame-street-and-ibm-watson-can-help-re-revolutionize-preschool-learning/?sh=43eac1ba27a2).
