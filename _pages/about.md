I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Information Studies, Univerisity of Maryland, College Park. I am a research assistant at the Intelligent Assistive Machines (IAM) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Hernisa Kaccori](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=El-R5MEAAAAJ). I am involved in the creation of accessible technology for teaching machine learning and explainable AI.

Previously I was a game designer and software engineer at StudyPad Inc. in late-Mid 2017, where I designed and developed games for learning math. And before that, I was a Research Scientist at IBM Research Labs, New Delhi, India. Primarily I work on the intersection of HCI and ML algorithms. At IBM, I designed machine learning-based technologies and used early childhood learning cases with Sesame Street.
