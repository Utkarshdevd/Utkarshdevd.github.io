I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Information Studies, Univerisity of Maryland, College Park. I am a research assistant at the Intelligent Assistive Machines (IAM) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Hernisa Kaccori](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=El-R5MEAAAAJ). I am involved in the creation of accessible technology for teaching machine learning and explainable AI.

Previously I was a game designer and software engineer at StudyPad Inc. in late-Mid 2017, where I designed and developed games for learning math. And before that, I was a Research Scientist at IBM Research Labs, New Delhi, India. Primarily I work on the intersection of HCI and ML algorithms. At IBM, I designed machine learning-based technologies and used early childhood learning cases with Sesame Street ([Forbes article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fibm%2F2016%2F04%2F27%2Fhow-sesame-street-and-ibm-watson-can-help-re-revolutionize-preschool-learning%2F%237515b24e27a2&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFB3TnI0gL2jKXwkXbyxxCzO1nyXA)) for IBM Research. We validated our work at the Gwinett county ([Techcrunch article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2017%2F06%2F07%2Fsesame-workshop-and-ibm-team-up-to-test-a-new-a-i-powered-teaching-method%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHXG1JiT7iFjuFNQyEV1OKM-U0ulg)). The finalized collaboration rewarded my efforts for the Watson Education business unit at IBM Research with Pearson Education ([Bloomberg article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2016-10-25%2Fe-learning-enters-bot-era-as-pearson-taps-ibm-s-watson-as-tutor&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFCXZ-b9rJzRsjRgFodtw1MVTVIfQ)).
